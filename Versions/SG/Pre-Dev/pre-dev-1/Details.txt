This is the first version released of the game, the start of our multi-year development journey. Most of what is seen here was changed in the coming years, but not everything...
Our development started on August 17th, 2021, on the Unity engine. This was also our start in our learning, one of the reasons why the game's development took so long. This was the first and only game we had worked on.
The debug level has been muted post production for copyright reasons.
